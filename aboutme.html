                <h2>Jamie Nelson</h2>
                <p>Hello!! I am Jamie Nelson, a student at the University of Oregon studying music technology. I have been in love with music for as long as I can remember. In high school, I decided I wanted to make a career out of my musical talents. Working with music fuels my creativity, whether I am singing with my chorus group, strumming my guitar, or plucking at notes on a piano.</p>
                <p>As a music technology major, most of my classes revolve around music, specifically the technological side of it. Music technology deals with getting musical ideas able to be streamed online. My classes teach me about the theory behind music and eventually, I will learn how to use different digital audio workstations.</p>
                <p>If I am not in class or working with my instruments, I am most likely skateboarding at the local skatepark, journaling in the comfort of my dorm room, spending time with my friends, or napping. These are the hobbies that take up most of my time. While making music is my passion, I also love spending my time with my other hobbies.</p>
                <p>My goal is to one day create my own record label. Through this label, I will sign many independant artists and ensure that their music is put onto streaming services. The genre of artists I plan to work with include people who are indie pop, eventually getting them to the point where they are decently known in their community as an artist.</p>
